# About Me

I am Yue Tang (<span style="font-family: KaiTi, 楷体, STKaiti, serif;">"唐越"</span> in Chinese characters), a Ph.D. candidate in Information Systems and Operations Management at Goizueta Business School, Emory University.

My research lies at the intersection of operations management and empirical methods, with a focus on supply chain networks, sustainability, and healthcare operations.

I am actively seeking collaborators for projects on supply chain resilience and on research at the intersection of supply chain management and healthcare operations.

The original username of this GitHub is "spicycook". To maintain my personal webpage, I tried to change it to "yuetang", "tangyue", "yue-tang", or "tang-yue", but all these options are already taken by others (how lucky we are to have so many humans with the same name pinyins!). Thus, I am using "YueTang-YT" now, where "YT" is my initials.
