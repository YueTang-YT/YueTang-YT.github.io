# About Me

第一，我不叫喂，I am Yue Tang (<span style="font-family: KaiTi, 楷体, STKaiti, serif;">"唐越"</span> in Chinese characters), a Ph.D. candidate in Information Systems and Operations Management at Goizueta Business School, Emory University. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Nikolay Osadchiy.

The original username of this GitHub is "spicycook". To maintain my personal webpage, I tried to change it to "yuetang", "tangyue", "yue-tang", or "tang-yue", but all these options are already taken by someone else. Thus, I am using "YueTang-YT" now where "YT" is my initials.
