I am Yue Tang, a Ph.D. candidate in Information Systems and Operations Management at Goizueta Business School, Emory University. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Nikolay Osadchiy](http://www.nikolayosadchiy.com).

My research lies at the intersection of operations management and empirical methods, with a focus on sustainability, supply chain networks, healthcare operations, and platform operations. I study how information—whether from firm disclosures, campaign narratives, or policy changes—affects operational and financial outcomes. Methodologically, I integrate causal inference and machine learning tools, including large language models (textual and visual), to analyze firm behavior, network structures, and user-generated content. My current projects examine the propagation and recovery from supply chain disruptions, the role of AI-generated content in medical crowdfunding, and the impact of trade policy on firms’ environmental responses through the lens of supply chain networks.
